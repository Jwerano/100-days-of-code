##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I completed a tic tac toe challenge on Code Club Projects

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed it.  It feels gratifying to get something done after days of meandering.

**Link to work:** I dont have a link to my work.  I should figure out how to do that here in GITHUB
